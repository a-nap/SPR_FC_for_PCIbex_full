    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p>Your task in this experiment is to read sentences. 
    These will be shown to you piece by piece. 
    First, an asterisk (<tt>*</tt>) will appear in the center of the monitor. 
    Press the <em>SPACEBAR</em> to view the sentence.
    At first, you'll see dashes representing the length of the sentence:</p>
    <div class='fancy'><p style="text-align: center;"><tt>___ ___ ____ __ ___ ____</tt></p></div>

    <p>To read the first part of the sentence, press the <em>SPACEBAR</em>:</p>

    <div class='fancy'><p style="text-align: center;"><tt>The ___ ____ __ ___ ____</tt></p></div>

    <p>As soon as you press the <em>SPACEBAR</em> again, the next sentence part will appear, and the previous part will disappear.
    This will continue until you reach the end of the sentence. 
    After reading the last part of the sentence, press the <em>SPACEBAR</em> to continue.</p>
    <div class='fancy'><p style="text-align: center;">
        <tt>___ cat ____ __ ___ ____</tt><br>
        <tt>___ ___ sits __ ___ ____</tt><br>
        <tt>___ ___ ____ on ___ ____</tt><br>
        <tt>___ ___ ____ __ the ____</tt><br>
        <tt>___ ___ ____ __ ___ mat.</tt></p></div>

    <p>Read the sentences at your usual speed and make sure you understand the meaning.
    Please always keep one finger on the <em>SPACEBAR</em> while reading.</p>

    <p>Some sentences will be followed by a question with two answers about the sentence you just saw.
    Please answer this question by either clicking on the appropriate answer or pressing <tt>d</tt> (=<em>LEFT</em>) or <tt>j</tt> (=<em>RIGHT</em>).
    Once you select an answer, you cannot change it. 
    For example, a question might look like this:</p>

    <div class='fancy'><p style="text-align: center;">Who or what was mentioned in the sentence?<br>
    d = A cat &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j = A dog</p></div>

    <p>You'll begin by practicing with 9 examples, followed by the actual experiment.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions about the task or if you're experiencing technical difficulties, please contact the experimenter: <br>

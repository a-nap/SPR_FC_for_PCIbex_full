PCIbex version 2.0, Jan 29.2025

Programmed by Anna Pryslopska (pryslopska.com).
Please report bugs to: `anna.pryslopska [at] gmail.com`. This is an updated version of [this experiment](https://github.com/a-nap/spr_experiment).

## Description

![Phrase-by-phrase presentation](spr.gif)

The self-paced reading paradigm is a method used in psycholinguistics to study sentence processing. Participants read a sentence in word-by-word or phrase-by-phrase, pressing a button to reveal each segment. In this implementation, the sentence segments that were revealed, disappear as soon as the next segment is displayed. The sentence is followed by a screen which records the answers to a forced-choice comprehension question.
Two versions of the experiment are provided: Phrase-by-phrase and word-by-word presentation.

This code sets up an online psycholinguistic experiment using PCIbex, handling participant instructions, displaying reading materials, inserting comprehension questions with attention checks, and tracking accuracy.
